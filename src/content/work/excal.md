[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) is an extremely popular open-source virtual whiteboard with a unique hand-drawn style.
Whilst I've been fortunate enough to contribute to the open-source editor as well, I'm mostly working on [Excalidraw Plus](https://plus.excalidraw.com), a SaaS built on top of the open-source editor. E+ offers powerful management and collaboration features for teams and individuals alike.
In my day-to-day, I work with the following stack extensively:

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwindcss, Sass
- Firebase
- Lambda functions
- NodeJS Express backend
