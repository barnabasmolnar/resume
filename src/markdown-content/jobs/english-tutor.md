I've been giving private lessons for a number of years now, preparing students for various locally and internationally recognised exams. I've also helped my students prepare for their studies or employment opportunities abroad. I enjoy **collaborative and creative work** and mostly prefer working with those who already have at least basic/intermediate competence in the language. I'm also interested in the area of **linguistics**, with a focus on applied linguistics in particular.
